Hopefully you now know the basics of how if works. You might be wondering why use 'else if' if it's the same as 'if'.

using else if:

if distance <= 1 {
  print "Distance is within a meter.".
} else if distance <= 100 {
  print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
} else {
  print "Distance is farther than 100 m.".
}

just using if:

if distance <= 1 {
  print "Distance is within a meter.".
}
if distance <= 100 {
  print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
}
if distance > 1000 {
  print "Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.".
}

We now run into some problems: if your distance is less than a meter you'll get the following messages:
Distance is within a meter.
Distance is within 100 meters.
Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.

As you can imagine this isn't good. If we're at less than a meter away from something and the commands for if we would be farther
than 1 kilomneter show up we have a big problem. This could be fixed by doing the following, but THIS IS UNNECESSARILY complex:

set NotDone to true.

if NotDone {
  if distance <= 1 {
    print "Distance is within a meter.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}

if NotDone {
  if distance <= 100 {
    print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}

if NotDone {
  if distance > 1000 {
    print "Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}

Now this essentialy does the same as the 'else if' script but it's way more confusing and complicating.
