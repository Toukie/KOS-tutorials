To use KOS you need to have a KOS processor on your vessel, they can be found under the 'control' tab in the editor and are under 
the same tab as the RCS thrusters and the reaction wheels.
Right clicking the KOS processor in the editor after adding it to your vessel shows a screen where you can tweak settings of the
KOS processor.

There are two ways you can create KOS scripts: either you make them in game and edit them in game or you use a text editor.

First we'll look at making and editing scripts in game.
Put your vessel with KOS processor on the launchpad and right click the processor.
Press the button that says 'open terminal' and click on the window that just popped up.

typing the following will create a file called 'hello', to enter the command press <ENTER> (don't forget the period at the end):

edit hello.

you can now edit the file and make your script for the processor to execute, the other tutorials will show how you can make a 
working script. Keep in mind that files made in game dissapear after the vessel is gone.

To run the file, type:

run hello.

To use a text editor instead go to your KSP folder and go to /Ships/Script and create an empty file and name it whatever you want
(be cautious using spaces in filenames because this might mess stuff up). All KOS script files should end with .ks.
An example of a valid KOS script file name would be:

hello.ks

Running files you made using text editors is a bit more complex than if you'd make a file in game.
This is because when you make a script in game the script is locally stored on the ship.
Files you made with a text editor are saved in the archive, can be accessed from different saved games and won't be lost after
the vessel is gone. You could compare it with ground control, which has infinite data storage and a spaceship which has limited
space for data.

To access the archive type:

switch to 0.

To run hello.ks type the same as above:

run hello.
