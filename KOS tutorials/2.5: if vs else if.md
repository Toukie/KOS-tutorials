#`If` vs `else if`
Hopefully you now know the basics of how `if` works. You might be wondering why use `else if` if it's the same as `if`.

### Using `else if`

```
if distance <= 1 {
  print "Distance is within a meter.".
} else if distance <= 100 {
  print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
} else {
  print "Distance is farther than 100 m.".
}
```

### Only using `if`

if distance <= 1 {
  print "Distance is within a meter.".
}
if distance <= 100 {
  print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
}
if distance > 1000 {
  print "Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.".
}

We now run into some problems: if your distance is less than a meter you'll get the following messages:
```
Distance is within a meter.
Distance is within 100 meters.
Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.
```

As you can imagine this isn't good. If we're at less than a meter away from something and the commands for if we would be farther
than 1 kilometer show up we have a big problem. This could be fixed by doing the following, but **THIS IS UNNECESSARILY** complex:

```
set Done to false.

if Done = false {
  if distance <= 1 {
    print "Distance is within a meter.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}

if Done = false {
  if distance <= 100 {
    print "Distance is within 100 meters.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}

if Done = false {
  if distance > 1000 {
    print "Distance is farther than 1 kilometer.".
    set NotDone to false.
  }
}
```

Now this essentially does the same as the `else if` script but it's way more confusing and complicating.
